Preferably run the program with python 3.11.7.
The following packages need to be installed in the environment:
- clean_text
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- gensim

Run the cleantext function on the dataset (995,000_rows.csv) to produce the cleaned .csv file (cleaned_dataset_big.csv). Save this file in the same folder as the program. Run both the simple and advanced model on the cleaned dataset.
